# Let's Cook
A good proof of concept for android in the consumption of API REST to show the detail of some edible products

# Architecture
For the development of this proof of concept I have chosen to use the MVP architecture, above MVVM because we do not need to communicate with many views and so much data so we do not need live data, RxJava or RxAndroid at this poit.

# Notes
- I hope to upload a similar POC exercise with other architectures. 
- Feel in complete confidence to contribute to this project :)
